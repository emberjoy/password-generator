# Password Generator 


This web application can be used to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters. The password generator will prompt the user to choose the criteria they would like include in their password such as numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. If the user does not choose any of the given criteria options, the password generator will default to givng the user a random password containing lowercase letters only.
